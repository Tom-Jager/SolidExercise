# SolidExercise
Example repo for cleaning up with SOLID principles

This repo is a Java solution to the Triangle Problem. It is a command line app that takes an input file and output file as arguments. It then processes the files according to the problem outlined in TriangleProblem.pdf

This code does not follow the SOLID principles, it is designed to give new developers an exercise to practice increasing cohesion and decreasing coupling in a codebase.
